title: CloudFlex API
description: Think of a virtual site as a digital twin of a FlexBox. It’s set up in AWS just like a FlexBox, and all its data lives right alongside FlexBox data. This means you get all the benefits of our existing tools, plus the freedom to customize your virtual sites as needed.

The CloudFlex API enables organizations to manage their virtual sites.

## Development Levels

The CloudFlex API is available in three different stages, each designed for a specific purpose:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Next">
        Where the newest features land first. The Next stage is for testing bleeding-edge code, so things here may not always work as expected.<br/>
        <Link href="https://api.io-comms.com/next/">https://api.io-comms.com/next/</Link>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Development">
        Features preparing for production are tested here. The Development stage is great for getting ready for upcoming changes, but be aware that things can still break.<br/>
        <Link href="https://api.io-comms.com/dev/">https://api.io-comms.com/dev/</Link>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Production" defaultOpen="true">
        This is the stable release, where all features have been thoroughly tested and are ready for everyday use.<br/>
        <Link href="https://api.io-comms.com/v1/">https://api.io-comms.com/v1/</Link>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
    For third-party integrations, we recommend using the <b>Production</b> or <b>Development</b> stages. The <b>Next</b> branch is intended mainly for internal testing and may not be reliable for external use.
</Warning>

## Login

All CloudFlex API endpoints require a JSX bearer token for authentication. You can obtain this token by sending a POST request to the login endpoint with your partner username and password. Here’s how to do it in various languages:

<CodeGroup>

    ```python login.py
    import requests

    url = "https://api.io-comms.com/v1/auth/login"
    data = {
    "username": "<USER_EMAIL>",
    "password": "<USER_PASSWORD>"
}
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
    print(response.json())
    ```

    ```javascript login.js
    const fetch = require('node-fetch');

    const url = 'https://api.io-comms.com/v1/auth/login';
    const data = {
    username: '<USER_EMAIL>',
    password: '<USER_PASSWORD>'
};
    fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
})
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json));
    ```

    ```bash login.sh
    curl --location 'https://api.io-comms.com/v1/auth/login' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
    "username": "<USER_EMAIL>",
    "password": "<USER_PASSWORD>"
}'
    ```

</CodeGroup>

The output will look like this:

```json
{
  "token": "<JSX_BEARER_TOKEN>",
  "refreshToken": "<REFRESH_TOKEN>",
  "type": "partner" // can also be "admin" or "consumer"
}
```
Explanation:

<ResponseField name="token" type="string">
    The JSX bearer token, to be used on protected calls
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="refreshToken" type="string">
    Use this token to refresh your session without needing to log in again with your username and password.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="type" type="string">
    <Expandable title="Possible values">
        <ResponseField name="admin" type="string">Lifepowr Admin user (rare for third parties)</ResponseField>
        <ResponseField name="partner" type="string">Partner user (most common for partners)</ResponseField>
        <ResponseField name="consumer" type="string">End user (typically at the app level)</ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## CloudFlex API Workflow Example

Below is a typical workflow for using the CloudFlex APIs to manage your virtual sites and assets:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Login & Authenticate] --> B[Create Site]
B --> C[Add Site Asset]
C --> D[Send Site Data]
D --> E[Collect Set Points]
E --> F[Monitor & Update]
```

---

### Authenticate
- Send a POST request to the [login endpoint](/pages/api/introduction) with your credentials to obtain a bearer token.

### Create a Site
- Use the [Create Site](/pages/api/create-sites) endpoint to register a new virtual site.

### Add Assets to the Site
- Use the [Add Site Asset](/pages/api/add-site-asset) endpoint to associate assets with your site.

### Send Device Data
- Periodically send operational data to your site using the [Send Site Data](/pages/api/send-site-data) endpoint.

### Collect Set Points
- Retrieve the latest set points for your site using the [Collect Set Points](/pages/api/collect-set-points) endpoint and apply them to your devices.

### Monitor and Update
- Use [List Sites](/pages/api/list-sites), [Basic Site Information](/pages/api/basic-site-information), and [Site Savings & Earnings](/pages/api/site-savings-earnings) to monitor your sites.
- Edit or remove sites/assets as needed using the appropriate endpoints.

<Tip>Repeat steps 4 and 5 in a loop to keep your virtual site data and control set points up to date.</Tip>
