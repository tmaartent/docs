You can narrow down the results using these querystring parameters:

<ParamField query="queryString" type="string">
    A string representing an [AWS IoT query string](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/query-syntax.html), used to narrow down the list of returned devices.
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="nextToken" type="string">
    If there are more sites to show, you’ll get a pagination string with your list. You can use this string to keep browsing through the rest of your sites.
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="maxResults" type="string">
    This number sets the maximum results you’ll see at once. If there are more results than this, you’ll get them in separate pages.
</ParamField>
