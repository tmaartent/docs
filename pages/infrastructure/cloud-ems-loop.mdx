There are two main components in the EMS Loop:

## Orchestrator Function

The orchestrator acts as the central coordinator. Every minute it will

    B[Gather virtual sites]
    C[Divide into manageable groups]
    D[Package information for each group]
    E[Launch EMS Function for each group]

    B --> C --> D --> E
```

This approach ensures the system remains organized and scalable.

## EMS Function

The EMS function will

    B[Collect latest device information]
    C[Run Flexio EMS]
    D[Store new set points for API access]

    A --> B --> C --> D

```

The EMS function is designed to run concurrently and on-demand, as triggered by the orchestrator.
