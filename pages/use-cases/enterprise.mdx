# What can be done in CloudFlex?

1. **Create a virtual site** for each location with the correct settings.
2. **Send site data** from each site on a regular basis (not faster than once per minute, not slower than once every 7.5 minutes).
3. **Collect set points** processed by CloudFlex for each device.

By following these steps regularly, the Cloud EMS Loop can optimize site operations. It’s important that the organization applies the set points as provided, to ensure optimal performance.

> **Tip:** Regular data updates help maintain proper control, especially for monthly peak and imbalance management.
