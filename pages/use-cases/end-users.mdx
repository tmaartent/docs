# What is expected of the end user?

1. **Allow CloudFlex to control their devices** via the device brandâ€™s API.
2. **Provide unique site and device information** so CloudFlex can create a virtual site and configure the correct settings.

# Integrations loop

Once these steps are done, the [Integrations Loop](/pages/infrastructure/integrations-loop) will handle data collection and device control automatically.
It does this through each brand's API.

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="End-user authorization flow">
        Users must authorize CloudFlex to access and control their devices, usually via [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) or a brand-specific process.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="CloudFlex Integration">
        CloudFlex connects to device brands via their cloud APIs to collect all the [required data](/pages/use-cases/enterprise) and send set points.

- **End-user authorization flow:** Users must authorize CloudFlex to access and control their devices, usually via OAuth or a brand-specific process.
- **CloudFlex Integration:** CloudFlex connects to device brands via their cloud APIs to collect data and send set points.
- **Valorizing a CloudFlex Integration:** Ensuring the integration is set up and used to its full potential.

### Supported CloudFlex Integrations (under evaluation)

<Warning>Each device brand may require a different integration and authorization method. External documentation may be needed for bespoke integrations.</Warning>
